| PingCount | The number of pings for each address. | Required | `3` |
| PingInterval | The time to wait (seconds) between each ping. | Required | `1 (second)` |
| PingTimeout | The timeout (seconds) for each ping. | Required | `10 (seconds)` |
| LogzioListener | The Logz.io listener URL for your region. (For more details, see the regions page: https://docs.logz.io/user-guide/accounts/account-region.html) | Required | `https://listener.logz.io` |
